Rule templates are JSON, like the other templates, and are a list of rules to
apply. Each rule needs to contain the following items:

    severity
    check_id    -- should probably be set to "{check_id}" which will be
                   replaced with the correct check ID.
    criteria    -- What the rule matches on. Valid values are:
                    Numeric:
                        Max Value
                        Min Value
                        On Absence
                    String:
                        Match
                        Does Not Match
                        Contains
                        Does Not Contain
                        On Change
                        On Absence

    value       -- The value for the criteria. For 'On Change' or 'On Absence'
                   criteria, this should be set to 'true'
    metric_name -- The name of the metric for the rule
    metric_type -- The type of the metric (TODO - this shouldn't be needed)
    order       -- The order the rule should be applied in (number)
    contact_group -- A list of contact groups for the rule.

Example:

[
    {
        "severity": 1,
        "check_id": "{check_id}",
        "value": "0.5",
        "criteria": "Max Value",
        "metric_type": "numeric",
        "order": 1,
        "metric_name": "average",
        "contact_groups": ["On Call"]
    },
    {
        "severity": 1,
        "check_id": "{check_id}",
        "value": true,
        "criteria": "On Absence",
        "metric_type": "numeric",
        "order": 2,
        "metric_name": "average",
        "contact_groups": ["On Call", "Managers"]
    }
]
